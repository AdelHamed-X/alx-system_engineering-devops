Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: March 9, 2024, 03:45 UTC
End Time: March 9, 2024, 08:20 UTC

Impact:
The outage affected the availability of our main web application, resulting in slow response times and intermittent service disruptions. Approximately 30% of users experienced degraded performance or were unable to access the platform during the incident.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfigured load balancer that caused uneven distribution of traffic among backend servers.

Timeline:

03:45 UTC: Issue detected by automated monitoring system as latency exceeded predefined thresholds.

03:50 UTC: Engineering team received automated alert and initiated investigation.

04:00 UTC: Initial assumption was that the issue might be related to database performance. Database servers were inspected, but no anomalies were found.

05:15 UTC: Investigation expanded to frontend servers, suspecting issues with content delivery. No significant findings.

06:30 UTC: Misleading assumption led to the suspicion of a DDoS attack. Security team engaged to investigate further.

07:00 UTC: Escalation to senior infrastructure engineers and DevOps team as initial investigations yielded no conclusive results.

08:20 UTC: Root cause identified as misconfigured load balancer, leading to uneven distribution of traffic and server overload.

08:30 UTC: Load balancer reconfigured to evenly distribute traffic, resolving the issue.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The misconfigured load balancer settings caused an imbalance in traffic distribution, overwhelming certain backend servers while leaving others underutilized.

Resolution:
The load balancer configuration was corrected to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers. Additionally, monitoring thresholds were adjusted to trigger alerts earlier in case of future imbalances.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations across all environments.
Implement automated testing for load balancer configurations to detect potential issues before deployment.
Enhance monitoring alerts to provide more granular details on performance metrics, aiding quicker identification of issues.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Document and maintain load balancer configurations to prevent misconfigurations in the future.
Develop and implement a regular audit schedule for critical infrastructure components.
Conduct a training session for the engineering team on load balancer best practices and troubleshooting techniques.
